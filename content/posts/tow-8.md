Chromag was born and lives in Sheffield, England - a city with a rich electronic music scene bringing us artists such as Aphex Twins, Andy Weatherall, and Toddla T, who have had a big influence on Chromag while growing up.

Chromag's music ranges from Deep house and Minimal Techno, though as he produces the music guides him and forms into any type of genre it takes him.
