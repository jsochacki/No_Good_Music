Amongst those that know him, The Deadly Power of Custard (to give him his full title ... at least for now!) has developed a reputation as something of a mad scientist in his approach to sound design. With this track, he's taken a vocal by singer and producer Karmel JÃ¤ger and embedded it into a sonic realm that is typically detailed and innovative. Over time, you too will learn to be excited to see what he comes out with next...
