The vote is in!, Sole Vale is this weeks winner. Sole Vale is an up and coming producer who aims to guide the listener into a dark and mysterious landscape. "Neglect" is somewhat unsettling with driving bass and guitars to add to the dark and forest scenery. Sole Vale is the entity inside your nightmares to defend you from evil!
