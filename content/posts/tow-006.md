The votes are in and ... Hanz Ford & Deadly Custard are this week's winners with their collaboration track MONSTER!

Hanz Ford hails from Kingston Ontario Canada and is a producer focused on Deep House and Electronic, with a variety of other styles in his arsenal. Hanz has been producing for just over 2 years but has a sound that reflects a seasoned producer.

Deadly Custard comes from Somerset, United Kingdom and produces a variety of music ranging from French House, to his newer, darker electronic style.  Deadly has been producing for about 10 years but has really focused on his craft this last year.

These two met in the Deadmau5 MasterClass and have since been redefining their sound, resulting in this collaborative track spanning from Electronic, Dark, and Deep House.

Enjoy MONSTER!
