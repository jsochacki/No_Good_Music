The votes are in and...Sysdemes is this weeks winner (again)!

Sysdemes hails from San Diego, CA. He makes a unique blend of Electro and Tech-House, with ever stronger hints of techno to keep things interesting... This track is his third release with the label [Emercive](https://www.emercive.com/), after his track "Insight" on their debut compilation 'Converge Vol.1' and "Frozen" his hot collaboration with D.O. ([former track of the week winner...](http://audioapostles.org/2018/04/19/track-of-the-week-frozen-d-o-sysdemes/)). [EMERCIVE](https://www.emercive.com/) (pronounced 'immersive') is a North American, not-for-profit, independent record label launched in 2018 by electronic music producer Rhyot.
