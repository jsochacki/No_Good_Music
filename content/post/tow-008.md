The votes are in and ... Chro-mag is this week's winner with his song Signals! It was a tough week with all great submissions!

Chro-mag was born and lives in Sheffield, England - a city with a rich electronic music scene bringing us artists such as Aphex Twin, Andy Weatherall and Toddla T, who have had a big influence on Chromag while growing up.

Chro-mag's music ranges from Deep house and Minimal Techno, though as he produces the music guides him and forms into any type of genre it takes him. His influences are the likes of [Paul Woolford](https://twitter.com/PaulWoolford), [Theo Kottis](https://twitter.com/theokottis), [Steve Bug](https://twitter.com/steve_bug), [Ejeca](https://twitter.com/_ejeca), [Dusky](https://twitter.com/Duskymusic) and especially [Bicep](https://twitter.com/feelmybicep) most recently.

Have a listening to the winning track!
