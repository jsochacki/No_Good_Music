description: "I started making electronic music about 15 years ago.  I never really had the time to take a good go at it with my career path but as I have moved on in life I have found that I am unable to shake making music.  So that is what this site here is about.  Just me trying to get the music I make out there and share it with you: â€”No Good.

_No Good_ (Western: _just the worst_) For the last lifetime I have been a communications engineer.  I work on signal processing day in and day out and someday would like to apply it to audio as well ;).
